Exploring cluster algorithms for the three-state Potts model as an approximation of heavy-dense QCD in the canonical approach.

Setting this up in python, in hopes of simplifying experimentation.

Performance optimization will not be an immediate priority.

Have begun with straightforward and simplistic implementation that may need further significant refinements.

To run the cluster algorithm:
  python runCluster.py <nx> <ny> <nz> <#baryons>
                       <gamma> <#sweeps> <RNG seed> <output dir>

This sets up an nx*ny*nz lattice in the canonical sector with 3*#baryons quarks.  The Potts model coupling is gamma and #sweeps sweeps are done with a (Mersenne Twister) random number generated initialized with the given seed.  Output is written to certain files in the given output directory, which is created if it does not yet exist.  Existing files in the output directory are overwritten.

TODO:
  Routines to save and load configurations (and append to output files rather than overwriting them)
